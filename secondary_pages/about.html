					<h1>About Me</h1>
					<p>My name is Larry.  I have worked in numerous technology related jobs thoughout my
						life.  Through various experience and education, I have gained a good understanding
						of how websites function including the underlying infrastructure.  I will be 
						completing my masters at East Carolina University in May 2016, majoring in network technology.  
						While doing so, I find myself working for the local school system here in Wilmington, NC
						providing end-user support and overseeing the organization's webiste.</p>
					<p>In the meantime, I am really trying to focus on the LAMP stack, which involves me setting up
					    a Linux machine in the cloud to host the apache server that this website runs atop. 
					    I feel this gives me full exposure to the underpinnings of what makes a website tick by
					    building it from the ground up, while also letting me work with MySQL and a scripting 
					    language.</p>  
					 <p>If you found this page in search of a web service, please know that I will help you in
					 	any way I can, but if I feel your needs are out of the scope of my abilities, or if you have 
					 	a strict deadline that cannot be met, I will let you know.</p>
					 <p>Thanks for visiting!</p>
